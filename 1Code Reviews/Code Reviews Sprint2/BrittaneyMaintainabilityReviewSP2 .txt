Reviewing LinkFacingStates for maintainability. 

This class is extremely easy to understand. All methods in ILinkState are implemented
except for NoInput(), because when we are in a "facing" or idle state 
there is no need to be primed to accept a "no input" command as we are already in a no
input state. The code will be very easy to change if needed as the functions being implemented are
extremely short and don't have any complicated logic. Only thing that may be changed is the
link field may need to be readonly.
