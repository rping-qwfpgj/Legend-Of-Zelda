Specific comments on quality: 
Very maintainable, would be easy to add in more functionality, either with new cases in the current switch
statement or making another switch statement. Does well with passing other functions(such as sprite class insubstantiation)
to other classes. Class is very cohesive, only does a few key functions needed to handle the colission.
