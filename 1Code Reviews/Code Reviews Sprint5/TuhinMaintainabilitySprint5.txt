Specific comments on code quality: 
	This class has a high size, but each function does well at sticking to one function. Adding in new behaviors
would be simple, as it would simply involve updating the enum of Dodongo actions and adding a few new cases. The 
only main critique is perhaps finding a way to extract some functions into a helper class to allow the length to be lower.
