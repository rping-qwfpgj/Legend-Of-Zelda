Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: BoomerangSprites.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Brittaney Jin
Specific comments on code quality: 
	- using an array of source rectangles is good since it makes it easier to change source rectangles if needed
	- switching between source rectangles is based on the variable maxFrames rather than a magic number which is very good for maintainability
	- each of the classes for each direction are implemented in the same way so changing them would be easy since we would make the same changes to each class
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	- a hypothetical change to make could be changing the animation speed of the boomerang 
	- making this change would be really easy as you would just need to change the value of the maxFrames variable
	- to make it slower, we would increase maxFrames and vice versa to make the animation faster
