*Reviewing for maintainability*

The class is 170 lines as of the time of review. There are many fields, but they are well named. If functionality was to be added, it would not be hard to add more sprites 
to the List<List<Rectangle>> sourceRectanglesLists. The math for updating positions is very simple, but could easily be modified to alter the behavior of the sprites shooting
out from impact of the master sword projectile.
