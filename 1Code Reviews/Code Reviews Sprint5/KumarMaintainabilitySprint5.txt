*Reviewing for maintainability*

This class is moderate in size and high in cohesion as its only contains one purpose which is to generate random room XML's. It only contains one behavioral method called
newGraph() which generates the rooms into a graph.Future funcitonality would be easy to implement as for this class we can modify its instance variables. A future change could be randomly choosing
door positions rather than haveing them be pre set and that would be easy to do.
