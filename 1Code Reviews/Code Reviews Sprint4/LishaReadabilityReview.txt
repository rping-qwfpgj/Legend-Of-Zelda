Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
	- having an array of source rectangles makes the code much cleaner to read
	- having each direction mapped to a certain int also makes the code cleaner
	- would be nice to have comments explaining how the destination rectangles are set based on direction
	- since the class uses a texture atlas, makes setting the source width and height much easier
