*Reviewing for maintainability*

This file is composed of four separate classes, one for each direction that Link can face.

For FireUpSprite:

Class is accurately named. The fields are a mix of private and public, though none of them need to be public. This is an easy change to implement. 

There are also many magic numbers that hard to edit and change because their purpose is not clear. More specifically, the sourceRectangles and 
destinationRectangles require many parameters, and it is hard to tell what the parameters represent when they are magic numbers without descriptive
names. 

The class uses integers that increment with every call to the Update() function. This functionality makes it easy to draw the sprites in the correct 
position on screen using the local xPosition and yPosition variables. There is a public Vector2 getPosition() function that returns these two 
floats to whatever class has an instance of the class, but this function is not called anywhere. It could be removed the getPosition definition were
removed from the ISprite class, and put in a subinterface extending ISprite for the sprites that need to communicate their positions to the Link
class. This would be relatively easy to implement.
