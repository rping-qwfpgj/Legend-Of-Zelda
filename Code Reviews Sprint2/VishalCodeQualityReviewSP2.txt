Sprint 2
Link.cs (assessed on Code Quality)
minutes: 15

Notes: Link class seems to utilize abstraction and the state design pattern quite well. His behavioral methods are very simple and
abstract the details to his state and individual sprite classes. Link.cs is only 115 lines. One thing 
that raises a little bit of concern are Link's instance variables. Most are declared public and Link is 
passed around quite a bit throughout the code base. This means most classes and methods can easily modify 
his instance variables. While quality is good here, I think a necessary change is to make these private
and add behavioral/getter and setter methods in order to protect link properly. This will require a good 
bit of refactoring however as this change affects his state and sprite classes.
