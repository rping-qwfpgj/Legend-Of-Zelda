*Reviewing for readeability*

The singleton class has only one other field than the instance field, a Texture2D named spriteSheet. It is an accurate name and follows naming conventions. 

Line 27 has a comment that extends to 159, so you have to scroll to read it. 

It has a method Initialize(Texture2D spriteSheet) that is redundant and is never called that is cluttering up the class. The loadContent method is well named, as its
only line calls Content.load<Texture2D>(). 

The bulk of the class is composed of 4 methods: CreateThrowableUp(), CreateThrowableDown(), CreateThrowableLeft(), CreateThrowableRight. Each class has a very similar 
switch statement where the only difference is the sprites being created are either "Up, Down, Left, Right" sprites (e.g. BlueBoomerangRightSprite). There are 154
lines of code in the class, which is not fantastic but is also not horrible.
