Sprint 2
Stalfos.cs (assessed on readability)
minutes: 5

Notes: A pretty simple and readable class. Stalfos has a few class variables sections: frames, textures
and position/movment. The class contians update and draw, these are pretty self explanatory as updates to 
position and current frame are handled in update and draw picks which frame to draw with simple 
modulo math. As far as room for improvement goes, everything seems good and adding more comments
seems unecessary.
