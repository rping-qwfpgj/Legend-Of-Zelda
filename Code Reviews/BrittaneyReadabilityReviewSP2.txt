Reviewing the LinkAttackingSprites class for readability.

There are a good amount of comments for me to understand all variables. There is also a good amount of comments for me to see 
the functionality of all the code. All of the directions for the LinkAttackSprites look to be the same, and are not logically different from one 
another which makes sennse. There could be a comment explaining excactly what the isAttacking() function does, 
but I was able to figure it out.
