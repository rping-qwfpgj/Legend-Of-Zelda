Sprint2 Reflection

The Sprint2 Burndown chart accurately shows the work schedule of the team. You can see that we did not begin work until five days
after the sprint began. This lack of urgency came back later to haunt us, as we spent the last few days leading up to the 
deadline implementing the majority of the functionality. This was not fun for the team and left us exhausted, decreasing our
productivity. 

Even after we started we failed to read the requirements in full, and failed to use AzureDevOps to delegate tasks between 
team members or set deadlines for said tasks. Instead we spent a lot of time designing the Link class and making sure 
that every team member understood the state machine design pattern. In reality we wasted our time as only two people ended 
up working on the class and only they needed to understand the inner workings of the class. It was only towards the end
of the sprint that the responsibilities were clearly delegated and that each team member became responsible for individual
features and functionalities.

For the next sprint we will be using AzureDevOps to transparently delegate the work required from each teammate and set deadlines
according the recommended deadlines. We will also split the work in such a way that no one person will need to understand the 
inner workings of every piece of the program.
