Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
	- minor thing but in the constructor the instance variable names and parameter names are the same, would be easier to read if they were different
	- good comments explaining why the x or y position changes the way it does
	- might be helpful to include a comment explaining what the Color.Lerp function does
	- good comment explaining why the spriteBatch.Draw call with extra parameters was necessary
	- all 4 directions' classes are structured the exact same which makes it much easier to read
