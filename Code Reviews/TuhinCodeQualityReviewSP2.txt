Sprint 2
LinkWalkingStates.cs (Assessed on code quality)
minutes: 6

Notes: LinkWalkingStates seems to have some areas where more abstraction could be used. It feels like the states should not have
access to Link's currentSprite variable, and that Link.cs is where sprite changes should occur. Similar things can be said
about manipulating the isDamaged variable. I think that overall, the states should call functions Link has to change his
current sprite and isDamaged, not directly change them
