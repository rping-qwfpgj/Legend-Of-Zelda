*Reviewing for maintainability*

I find this code quite maintainable. It is very easy to update the graph as every
possible type of combination of rooms can be added easily. I do think that the visited
array could be tricky to work with, and it may be better to make the edges/tuples
their own type with a field called "visited." The way it is now could cause major errors if
the value of visited in an index i does not match what the correpsonding room should have as
its visited.
