Notes: The classes of this file are kept quite simple. All of the fields have a name that allows me to make accurate rough 
predictions on what each one's purpose is. There are some areas, however, where comments would be helpful to give a small
more in-depth explanation of what's happening. The first is in the Update functions, where some comments on what done being 
true/false means would be helpful. In Draw, it would be good to include some comments on why the height and width of desintation
rectangles are a number being multiplied by 4.
