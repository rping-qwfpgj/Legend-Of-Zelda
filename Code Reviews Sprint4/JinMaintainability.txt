*Reviewing for maintainability*


This class is very small as it has high cohesion. Thus making it very maintainable. The only method
is handleCollsion() and calls a behevioral methods on link, the enemy projectile and room. Future funcitonality
with the handler would be very easy to implment as we would be able to add more objects or conditional logic to just one method.
A future change could be adding more functionality to the enemy projctile link collsiion such as having a special audio snippet play or changing link's sprite,
this could be implemneted very easily.
