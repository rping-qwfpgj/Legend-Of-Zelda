*Reviewing for Maintainability*


This class is extremely maintainable, however, there are still things I would
change. This class is maintainable because it is based on a state-machine
which is highly documented and understandable. There are different commands
that send you to different states given the current Pause state. However, there are
a few things wrong with the logic. For example, the WinGame() method should be empty
as you should not be able win the game immediately out of a pause state. WinGame should
only be able to be accessed during the GamePlay() state.
