*Reviewing for readability*

This class is very unreadable. Some things I would change include:

-getGame() has no documentation on what it is supposed to accomplish. It looks
like it may be a method that loads sounds but its name is very misleading.The name 
may be changed to something that describes it more. 

-The fact that there are two TakeDamage functions with different parameters is
very unreadable. It is very unclear what these two functions are supposed to do.
These functions should be described or named something different as they clearly
seem to do different things or are used it different scenarios.

-Update() has many nested loops that make it very hard to understand what it
is trying to accomplish. 

-There are still many stray comments. unecessary lines of code should be deleted.
