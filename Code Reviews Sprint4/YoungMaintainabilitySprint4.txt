*Reviewing for maintainability*

The only field is a Dictionary<string, int> inventory. 8 "items" are added to the inventory when the class constructor is called.
The getItemCount(String str) method simply returns a the corresponding integer. This keeps the inventory field from being accessed 
directly by other classes. The addItem(Iitem Item) method is rather simple at the moment, but may need a helper function in the
future as more items are added to the game. This would be a simple change to implement. There is a special case where picking up 
a bomb will increment the appropriate integer by four, while other items only increment by one. If there were many other special 
cases then the method would become bloated. The removeItem(String str) method simple acts as a wrapper method for decrementing
the integer fields of the dictionary field.
