*Reviewing for readeability*

Graph.cs has a few global variables that are well name. Right away I can tell that each room has either a left-right tuple,
a up-down tuple or both. The constructor initializes these and the behovioral methods are also quite wellnaemd and easy to read as they
are mostly one liners and simple for loops with if statements. There is one magic number which is 18, which I know refers to the 
amount of rooms in the dungeon. Overall I would give Graph.cs a very good readability score.
