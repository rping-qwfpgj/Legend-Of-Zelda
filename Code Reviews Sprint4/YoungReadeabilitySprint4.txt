*Reviewing for readeability*

The fields declared in the class are well named and give a good approximation of what they are used for. The logic is at most two 
tabs deep in the Update() function. There are comments before the if and else logic in the method, explaining what is happening
behind the abstraction resulting from local private methods such as swapState. There is an outdated line of code that has been 
commented out in Update(). Draw() is very simple as usual. The biggest issue is that the swapState() method is a black box
with many magic numbers. As far as I can tell the method changes the state of the trap Sprite depending on Link's location.
