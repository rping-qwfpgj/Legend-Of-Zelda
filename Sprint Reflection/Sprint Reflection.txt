Sprint3 Reflection
Author: Brittaney Jin

The Sprint 3 burndown chart is more spread out than the last sprint, as our team worked more consistently throughout 
the sprint rather than doing the vast majority of the work the day before. The team's energy was much better in this 
sprint than the last.

The team also used Azure DevOps much more efficiently in this sprint, delegating many more tasks overall, and splitting
up issues into many more specific work items. This improved our productivity compared to the last sprint as we had more
detailed descriptions of the tasks that were needed complete an issue. 

Additionally, we changed the way that we delegated tasks. Before, we had a lot of redundancy because many people would 
work on the implementation of classes of a single interface, for example. This wasted time as implementations of different 
classes in a single interface require a lot of copy and pasting from other classes in the interface and would be much more 
efficient if done by just one person. Thus, in this sprint, instead of everybody working on 1/5th of everything, we split up
tasks so that groups of 1 or 2 would work on just one aspect of the game, and even though this meant not everyone had a
super in-depth understanding of a specific part, redundant work was reduced and we got more done in a shorter time. 

The majority of this sprint's work was creating functionalities for Rooms and Collisions in the game. For the next sprint,
we will be focusing on sound, room transition animation and graph representation of rooms, and health and inventory for link
and enemies. 




Sprint2 Reflection
Author: DJ Young

The Sprint2 Burndown chart accurately shows the work schedule of the team. You can see that we did not begin work until five days
after the sprint began. This lack of urgency came back later to haunt us, as we spent the last few days leading up to the 
deadline implementing the majority of the functionality. This was not fun for the team and left us exhausted, decreasing our
productivity. 

Even after we started we failed to read the requirements in full, and failed to use AzureDevOps to delegate tasks between 
team members or set deadlines for said tasks. Instead we spent a lot of time designing the Link class and making sure 
that every team member understood the state machine design pattern. In reality we wasted our time as only two people ended 
up working on the class and only they needed to understand the inner workings of the class. It was only towards the end
of the sprint that the responsibilities were clearly delegated and that each team member became responsible for individual
features and functionalities.

For the next sprint we will be using AzureDevOps to transparently delegate the work required from each teammate and set deadlines
according the recommended deadlines. We will also split the work in such a way that no one person will need to understand the 
inner workings of every piece of the program.
