The class is only 59 lines long, which makes it quick to read. Besides the constructor, there are five short methods. They are well named and clearly communicate what
they accomplish. The Update() method simply iterates through the local list of ISprite types and called .Update() on each object. The Draw() method does the same, but
calls .Draw() on each object. ReturnObjects() simply returns a copy of the local list, and the removeObject() and addObject() methods are simple one line methods. 
The only code that is confusing can be found on line 27:
if(!(sprite is ILinkAttackingSprite) && !(sprite is ILinkNonAttackingSprite)) { }

This checks to see if the sprite is a Link sprite, which is clarified by the comment on the line before:
// If the object is not link, then don't draw him, will cause multiple links.
