*Reviewing for maintainability*

Dragon boss is an IEnemy and has some necessary coupling as he is coupled with his orb projectiles. although this coupling may expand as EnemyProjectile collision is fixed.
He funcitons like most enemy classes although within his draw() he creates three orb projectile classes. These classes are low in coupling as well and simple in their function 
meaning they have high cohesion. 

Suggestions for changes: Dragon will need to find a way to add its orbs to the list 
of room objects upon creation. Perhpas coupling it with the currentRoom is necessary

have the dragon fire off instance of orbs rather than the same orb which will get re-drawn
at the begining of its update loop.

overall these classes are well made and well thought however they do have room for necessary
improvment so that they can be incremented upon and funcitonal for end-game features.
