Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
	- this class is extremely readable since there's only one line
	- since the logic for deciding which type of collision is occuring is in the collision delegator, the collision handler is super simple
	- for items, when link collides with them, they should be removed from the room, and it is clear to see that that is being implemented in the handleCollision function
	- in the future we will need to add something for adding the item to link's inventory
