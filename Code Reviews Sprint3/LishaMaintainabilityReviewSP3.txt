Date of the code review: 10/24/22
Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CollisionDetector.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Vishal Kumar
Specific comments on code quality: 
	- all fields are private, which is a good thing
	- the detectCollision method has high cohesion since it only does one thing - detect whether or not a collision has occurred
	- the update method has a lot of nesting, so that is something that we should try and extract into helper methods to help increase cohesion
	- since the constructor takes in link, room, and game, there is slightly high coupling
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	- a hypothetical change could be creating a new type of sprite that needs to be checked for collision
	- as long as that sprite implements/extends ISprite, the collision detector would not need to be changed at all since it iterates over a list of all of the ISprites in a room
