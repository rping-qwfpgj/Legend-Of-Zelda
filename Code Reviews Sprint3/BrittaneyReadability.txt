Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The update() method I believe is the weakest part in terms of readability. There are many if statements, 
and additionally an if-else statement that are not conceptually clear what they do. Additionally
there are magic numbers for position comparisons that seem arbitrary and I do not know what they
represent. Draw is very readable as there are just two cases to draw based on what number of frames there
are, although there could be a rectangle matrix that stores rectangles, and then they could be iterated 
instead of creating rectangles every time.
