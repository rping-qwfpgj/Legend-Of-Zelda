Specific comments on code quality:The nesting makes this class very difficult to understand, and I think that is its greatest weakness.
Making changes andupdating this class would be hard as you must think about what level of if else statements to make the changes, and 
additionally the many different cases also make this class hard to maintain. Additionally, because the two objects being passed in are not orderless, 
meaning there must be two cases in the if-else structure for one kind of collision. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
The classes objects being compared could be passed in as an orderless pair, halving the number of cases. All the logic would remain the same, 
but we would not need an "obj" and "otherObj", we'd just need to check when the pair meet the requirements for a certain case.
